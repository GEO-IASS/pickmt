Before running code:
Create a .mat file for each event.
.mat file contains a structure of Nsta rows, with metadata and integrated/rotated waveforms.


Start picking codes, input is list of .mat structures in path

For each event in list:
Create Figure 1
  eventID, Mw, map of stations and event, drop down list of stations in structure
  expand structure for additional fields for picking
User chooses station from list
Create Figure 2
  RTZ waveforms
  RTZ synthetic waveforms based on input metadata - save to structure
Create Figure 3
  picking menu, similar to old one
User picks phases for displayed set of waveforms, then selects 'done'
Figure 1 updates pulldown list to indicate that station has been picked
Once 3+ stations have been picked:
  compute mij for current picks after each station is finished
  update Fig 1 with 6 component values, deltaV, and beachball plot
