ADD:
- change station color or dropdown label or something in fig 1 after picked

Now allows picking, including selection of station from (ugly) dropdown menu.
Next goal: add code for inverting moment tensor results. 
Also update picking code to allow user to select pulse duration (see MB adjustments to code)

First iteration of code.
Goal: Main structure for picking GUI to produce Matlab structures. See Step 2 below.






----------------------------------------
Step 0: Outside of GUI
Load metadata and waveforms for one event into a Matlab structure.
Metadata includes: stationID, location info, event Mw, station locations, etc.


Step 1: Initialize control GUI, using data structure as input
Figure 1 appears, with:
	- event metadata (event ID, Mw)
	- map of event and stations, colorcoded by status and labeled
	- pulldown list of all stations, with an indicator for picked/notpicked
	- space to display results of inversion, including error and deltaV
	- button to compute mij (make automatic?)
	- space for a beachball and scaled isotropic ball for solution
	- button to create Fig 4
User selects a station from the list.


Step 2: Picking via picking GUI.

Figure 2 appears for selected station, with:
	- waveforms rotated into RTZ
	- 6 synthetics

Figure 3 appears with:
	- picking menu, similar to current menu

After picking is finished and at least 3 stations have been selected, allow for Fig 4 to be generated:
	- all waveforms and current best fit synthetics scaled to display all

After each station is analyzed, save results.

Step 3: Post-picking analysis. Separate set of codes.
